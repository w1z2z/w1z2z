Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vitaly

I'm an experienced backend developer with a strong proficiency in Node.js, Express, Nest.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and RabbitMQ. I've developed RESTful and GraphQL APIs and adhere to SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles. I'm familiar with Git, BitBucket, WebSocket (Socket.io), Google API, Docker, and JIRA. I have hands-on experience in developing Telegram bots (Telegraf-js) and frontend technologies, including React, Next.js, TypeScript, Redux/MobX, and MUI/ANTd. I'm ready for new challenges and committed to continuous learning.

Feel free to reach out to me through my Instagram profile at www.instagram.com/v1talya_181 or via Telegram at www.t.me/w1z2z. I'm always open to new opportunities and exciting projects.
