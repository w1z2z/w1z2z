Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vitaly

I'm a full-stack software developer with a strong focus on backend technologies. 

I have extensive experience in building robust and scalable server-side applications using Node.js. My technology stack includes Node.js (Nest.js/Express.js) for backend development and React (Redux/MobX) for frontend development , along with REST API/GraphQL, Websocket, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
I'm experienced in working with different databases, such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and I can design and optimize database schemas for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Feel free to reach out to me through my Instagram profile at www.instagram.com/v1talya_181 or via Telegram at www.t.me/w1z2z. I'm always open to new opportunities and exciting projects.
